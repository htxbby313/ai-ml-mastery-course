## Overview

Welcome to the **AI & Machine Learning Mastery Course**! This course provides a comprehensive and hands-on journey through the foundational and advanced concepts of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Designed for aspiring data scientists, AI engineers, and tech enthusiasts, this course combines theoretical knowledge with practical coding exercises and quizzes to ensure a deep understanding of the subject matter.

From the basics of AI and various learning paradigms to the intricacies of Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and advanced topics like Reinforcement Learning and Generative AI, you'll build a robust skill set ready for real-world applications.

## Features

*   **Interactive Learning:** Engaging content with clear explanations and practical examples.
*   **Hands-on Code Examples:** Integrated Jupyter Notebook code snippets using NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, and NLTK to reinforce learning.
*   **Knowledge Checks:** Quizzes at the end of each module to test understanding and unlock the next module.
*   **Progress Tracking:** A dynamic progress bar to visualize your journey through the course.
*   **Modern UI:** A clean, terminal-like interface built with Tailwind CSS for an immersive learning experience.
*   **Capstone Project:** A comprehensive final project to apply all learned concepts.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For structuring the course content.
*   **CSS3 (Tailwind CSS):** For responsive and modern styling.
*   **JavaScript:** For interactivity, module navigation, quiz logic, and progress tracking.
*   **Python Libraries (for hands-on examples):**
    *   `NumPy`: Numerical computing.
    *   `Pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
    *   `TensorFlow`/`Keras`: Deep Learning framework.
    *   `Scikit-learn`: Machine Learning utilities.
    *   `NLTK`: Natural Language Toolkit.

## Setup and Installation

To access and run this course locally, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Download the course files:**
    Obtain the course package (e.g., a `.zip` file containing `index.html` and any associated assets).
2.  **Unzip the package:**
    Extract the contents to a folder on your computer.
3.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. All course content and interactivity are self-contained within this single HTML file.

    _Note: The hands-on code examples are provided within `pre` tags and are meant to be copied and run in a separate Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab) to practice._

## How to Use

Navigate through the course using the "Next Module" and "Previous Module" buttons. Each module concludes with a "Knowledge Check" quiz. You must pass the quiz (achieve 80% or more) to unlock the next module. The progress bar at the top will visually indicate your advancement through the course.

For the "Hands-on" sections, it is highly recommended to copy the provided Python code snippets into a local Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or any Python environment to execute and experiment with them yourself. This practical application is crucial for mastering the concepts.
