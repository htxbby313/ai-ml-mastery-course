                <div class="prose text-neon-green max-w-none">
                    <h3>What is AI?</h3>
                    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science that gives machines the ability to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. It is a collection of techniques and algorithms that allow machines to mimic and even surpass human cognitive functions.</p>

                    <h3>Machine Learning (ML)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong> is a subset of AI that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed with rules, an ML model is trained on a large dataset to identify patterns and relationships. This allows it to make predictions or decisions about new, unseen data.</p>

                    <h3>Types of Learning</h3>
                    <p><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> The model is trained on a labeled dataset. Example: Training a model to identify spam emails.</p>
                    <p><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> The model is trained on an unlabeled dataset to find hidden patterns or structures. Example: Grouping customers into different segments based on purchasing behavior.</p>
                    <p><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties. Example: Training a self-driving car.</p>
                    <p>Think of it as a set of nested concepts: AI is the largest, ML is inside AI, and Deep Learning (DL) is inside ML.</p>
